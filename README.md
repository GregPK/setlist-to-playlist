# Setlist to Playlist

Mission statement:

Given any setlist, create a playable playlist of music.

Early version will focus on local media playlists and plain text setlists.

## Roadmap / todo

- Add debug data to see what the options were.
- Add an option to download a setlist from setlist.fm instead of providing one.
- Add fail fast option for quick errors
- Add more IO options (files) - just standard in/out now.

## Alternatives:

- [Setify.co](https://setify.co) - very solid if you want to make Spotify setlists, rather than local ones.
